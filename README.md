# Pomodoro-App
The Pomodoro Timer App is a productivity tool designed to enhance focus and efficiency during work or study sessions. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, this application helps users manage their time effectively by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
